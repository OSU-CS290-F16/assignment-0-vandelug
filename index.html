	<h1>Gregory L. Vandelune</h1>
	<h2>Senior, Computer Science</h2>
	<ul>
		<li> On a scale of 1 to 10, my knowledge level of HTML is about a 3 or 4.  I have had experience with web development for a couple of courses and personal exploration.  I feel comfortable, for the most part, but anything that requires artistic inclination is my achilles heel.  I would do much better reproducing a diagram with color schemes and style than I would with a blank slate.
		</li>
		<li> In this course, I hope to refresh the skills that I have already developed and learn new things that I am not aware of.  I try to maintain an open mindset when it comes to learning all things computer related.  Often, I find that I don't know what I don't know.  I look forward to learning anything new and refining my current skills.
		</li>
		<li> I have signed up for Piazza.
		</li>
		<li> The most interesting thing about me in this setting is probably my military experience.  I spent 10 years as a green beret, in 1st Special Forces Group.  That experience afforded me the opportunity to Mandarin Chinese and pick up basic language skills in Modern Standard Arabic, Pashtu, Urdu, and several other languages.  I have been to 26 different countries for both business and pleasure.
