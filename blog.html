	<p>The primary issue that I faced with this assignment was accessing the stak server.  I was able to connect to OSU via VPN on my mac without issue but when I attempted to connect to that actual server, it would not recognize my username.  After much frustration reading the OSU help pages, I resorted to trail and error.  Eventually, I accesed the server using my full email address.  Previously, just my ONID name (vandelug) was sufficient to access stak.</p>
	<p>Another issue that I faced was the aspect ratio on my photo.  I could not get it exactly how I wanted it to be but I believe this is in part due to my inability to take a proper selfie.  I feel comfortable manipulating things with the img tag but as I stated on the index page, artistic aspects are not my strong suit.</p>
	<p>I already had a working knowledge of HTML, git, github, etc.  The thing that I learned from this assignment was the center tag.  I had seen this tag before but do not recall ever using it.  Normally, I have used CSS to handle such things.  The one external resource that I used to reference syntax was <a href="http://W3schools.com/html">w3schools</a></p>
	<p>I read over the Piazza posts and responses to maintain my situational awareness with the course.  I did not need to use these as resources per se for this assignment since it contained simple, straight forward tasks.  Once I get a better feel of the course expectations, I have every intention of being active on Piazza.  Hopefully, I can share the limited knowledge that I have and learn from my peers.</p>
